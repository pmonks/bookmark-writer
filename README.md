# bookmark-writer

A simple and dumb Clojure library that provides the ability to set the text values of bookmarks in Word 2007 (.docx) format files.
Little more than a Clojure wrapper around [this docx4j sample class](https://github.com/plutext/docx4j/blob/master/src/samples/docx4j/org/docx4j/samples/BookmarksReplaceWithText.java).

## Installation

`bookmark-writer` is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/bookmark-writer):
